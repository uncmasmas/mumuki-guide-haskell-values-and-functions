Define `isLeapYear` function that indicates if a year has 366 days.

```haskell
ãƒ  isLeapYear 2000
True
```

A year is a leap-year if:

* is a multiple of 400, or
* is a multiple of 4 but is not multiple of 100

Remeber you can use `isMultipleof` function that takes two argument and says if the first argument is multiplous of the second argument.
