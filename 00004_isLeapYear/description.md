Define the `isLeapYear` function which indicates if a year has 366 days.

```haskell
ãƒ  isLeapYear 2000
True
```
A year is a leap year if it is a multiple of 400, or
it is a multiple of 4, but it is not amultiple of 100.

Remember you can use the function `isMultipleOf` that takes two arguments and says if the first argument is a multiple of the second argument.

```haskell
> isMultipleOf 8 2
True

> isMultipleOf 9 6
False
```
